Week 1: During week 1, I brainstormed a few ideas that I would like to pursue as visualizations.

Week 2: I chose three potential datasets and worked on familiarizing myself with the platform, VizHub. I also implemented the visualization's the professor gave the class as an example to help me with choosing which dataset I wanted to move forward with.

Week 3: This week, I honed in on the Rhode Island Unemployment Rate dataset and created a few sketch iterations to create a feel for what I wanted to make when I created my visualization. I also created a scatterplot based on the data.

Week 4: For this week, I worked on fine tuning my sketch and scatter plot to help me further my visualization idea.

Week 5: I submitted my first project proposal and a rough rendition of what my visualization looks like.

Week 6: This week was working on my visualization. I added red dots to display the spikes in the unemployment rate to improve comprehension of the visualization.

Week 7: This week, I worked on a hover function that accentuated the unemployment rates and displayed the year, month, and unemployment rate when the cursor hovered over the chart.

Week 8: BREAK-----

Week 9: I worked on improving comprehension while simultaneously working on how to make the line more prominent when hovering over the chart. During this week, I added a feature that would make the spikes and line pop out when hovering over it in the legend.

Week 10: Didn't change much, tweaked the interactivity a bit but improved it slightly.

Week 11: Added the national US unemployment rate to compare it to the RI unemployment rate. I followed along with Professor Kelleher's newest videos and added a vertical line to help visualize the difference between the two lines and highlight where they differ and where they are similar.
