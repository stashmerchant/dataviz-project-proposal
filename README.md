# Data Visualization Project

## Data

The data I used to visualize my final project are the Rhode Island Unemployment Rates and the National Unemployment Rates from 1976 to present time. I derived this information from this dataset: https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/RIUR

## Questions & Tasks

The following tasks and questions will drive the visualization and interaction decisions for this project:

 * How has the Rhode Island Unemployment Rate changed over time?
 * Where does the unemployment rate spike and drop?
 * Is it possible to pinpoint the exact unemployment rate at a specific year/month?

## Sketches

(First visualization portrays a trend over time of the unemployment rates in the state of Rhode Island. This visualization answers the second question by showing the spikes and drops)
(Second visualization portrays the average unemployment rate in the state of Rhode Island by decade. To provide more context, this visualization can go deeper on the last question as it can be used to pinpoint a specific year/month)

(This visualization portrays another trend over time of the unemployment rate but with anomalies highlighted, such as spikes in the unemployment rate. This visualization can aid in answering the third and fourth questions.)

## Prototypes

I’ve created a proof of concept visualization of this data. It's a scatterplot and it shows the unemployment rate trend over time.

## Open Questions

My goal for this project is to make it interactive and very detailed. I think there is a lot of potential in this dataset and I want to make the most out of it. However, I am not very confident that I will be able to attain what I truly am envisioning in my mind into reality. For example, I want to try and find a way that I can use another dataset that can be used to compare the Rhode Island unemployment rate vs the National unemployment rate.

## Milestones

Each week, I plan to add small tweaks to my overall goal. By the end of the end of this course, I should have been able to turn my vision into a reality with this visualization.

End of September: Finish the static visualization (prototype) by adding color and small details.

End of October: Add some interactivity.

End of November: Add depth and context -- this is where I can start to add the national comparison and highlight where these datasets overlap in the visualization.

End of the course period: Add finishing visualization details.
